This page highlights areas of current development,
separated into relevant categories.

### Flow physics
Neumann-BC solver
- VortexAD only supports a Dirichlet boundary condition formulation.
The Neumann no-penetration BC is better suited for unsteady flows.

### Geometry and meshing
Support for unstructured quad meshes and quad+tri meshes
- VortexAD currently only supports structured grids with quads and unstructured tri meshes.
