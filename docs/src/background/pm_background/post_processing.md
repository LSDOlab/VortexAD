<!-- Under the assumptions of potential flow, the Navier-Stokes momentum equation can be formulated as Bernoulli's equation:

$$\frac{1}{2}\rho |V|^2 + P = C$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $V$ is the velocity vector, $P$ is the static pressure and C represents the value of the streamfunction along the streamline.  -->
