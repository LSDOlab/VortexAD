# Basics


<!-- In linearized, incompressible potential flow, we aim to solve the Laplace equation everywhere in space: 

$$ \nabla^2 \phi = 0, $$

where $\phi$ represents the velocity potential. Green's identity can be applied to the Laplace equation to



Two different flow singularities are utilized: doublets $\mu$ and sources $\sigma$; doublets  and sources represent the incremental potential jump and velocity jump across the surface, respectively. -->
