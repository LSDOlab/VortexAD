    "# Meshing Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a guide on how properly mesh geometries to generate good panel method results. The power behind panel methods is the ability to capture flow behavior over **arbitrary** geometries. As a result, it is imperative that mesh refinement is incorporated in areas of high curvature and sharp corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This tutorial uses [OpenVSP](https://openvsp.org/) to generate both the aircraft geometry and mesh. Users can use and combine various software tools for generating geometries ([Engineering Sketch Pad](https://acdl.mit.edu/ESP/ESPreadme.txt)) and meshes ([GMSH](https://gmsh.info/), [NetGen](https://ngsolve.org/)) as long as the standard mesh metrics and the file format are maintained.\n",

    "This tutorial will focus on generating triangulated surface meshes, as the VortexAD panel method currently only supports this mesh type. We will illustrate this example on the ONERAM6 wing. Specs on this geometry can be found online (insert sources); we have included the OpenVSP file in the repository as well. This tutorial is focused on **mesh generation**, so we will leave out details related to geometry generation; please refer to the OpenVSP documentation for tips on generating geometries. Here we show the surface representation of the ONERA M6 geometry in OpenVSP, which is the starting point for generating a mesh.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The current geometry has a certain tessellation in the \"U\" and \"W\" direction; these correspond to the grid spacing in the spanwise and airfoil cross-section, respectively. The spanwise tessellation is measured from the root to tip, and the airfoil tessellation represents the spacing from the trailing edge to the trailing edge, wrapping around the airfoil. In the OpenVSP `Geom Browser`, we can select our `WingGeom` to see the exact grid tessellation; in this instance, U is 16 and W is 45. \n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, mesh refinement for panel methods is key to obtain accurate solutions. Mesh refinement typically targets areas of high curvature, like the leading edge, or sharp corners, like the trailing edge and wing tips. This can be controlled through the LE/TE clustering options in the `Plan` tab and the root/tip clustering options in the `Sect` tab. The geometry above uses LE/TE clustering of 0.25/0.5 and root/tip clustering of 0.5/0.15. Below is a geometry that uses a default of 1 for each.\n",
